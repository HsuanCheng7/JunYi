Forgive me using english instead, it's just a bit faster. Thank you.

question 3:
Take an item from the bag that is labelled "mixed". Since all bags are mislabelled, the "mixed" bag cannot be the real 
mixed bag. Thus, if I get a pen from that bag, then that bag is the pen bag. Then, because the bag that is labelled 
"pencil" cannot be the pencil bag, nor can it be the pen bag since pen bag is the one that's labelled "mixed". 
Therefore, "pencil" bag has mixed items, and then "pen" bag has pencils. The logic works the same way if I get a pencil 
from the "mixed" bag in the beginning.


question 4:
900 != how much they paid + how much the worker stole
900 = how much the worker gave back + how much they paid (since they didn't actually pay 900)
how much they paid already includes how much the worker stole, it's the amount that the worker gave back to them is 
missing.
